# Angular Product App

This project is an Angular 18 client-side application built using the Angular CLI. It demonstrates a product list management system that uses modern Angular features including standalone components, lazy-loaded feature modules, and an in-memory data service for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- **Product List Display**: Shows a list of products with a simulated loading screen.
- **CRUD Operations**: Allows you to create, edit, and delete products using an in-memory service.
- **Lazy Loading**: The product feature is encapsulated within an Angular library and lazy loaded to optimize application performance.
- **Standalone Components**: Utilizes Angular standalone components to simplify module management.
- **Client-Side Routing**: Configured routing ensures the app runs on `http://localhost:4200` (redirecting from the Angular homepage).
